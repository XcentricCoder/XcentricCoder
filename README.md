## 🔧 FPGA & Open-Source EDA Experience

- Yosys – Worked with open-source synthesis tool for digital hardware designs (Verilog/SystemVerilog).
- NPR – Used for placement and routing in FPGA flows.
- Project IceStorm – Explored bitstream generation and FPGA programming for Lattice iCE40 devices.
- Flow Integration – Hands-on with the open-source FPGA toolchain to design, synthesize, and map hardware designs onto FPGAs.
